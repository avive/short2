    <h2>Moving into blockchain! Come and become part of my work and my artistic practice.</h2>
    <p>I am pleased to announce my new exploration of art and blockchain.</p>
<p>I’m entering the blockchain with ​Team Human Project, a​ new art project which enables art lovers, investors and collectors to participate in my art practice and collect my work using the blockchain as the main platform.</p>
<p>The project is both an exploration of blockchain’s language and mechanisms, and a new form of connection between visual art, artist and audience.
The project includes a video piece, prints, a blockchain certificate and a crypto-token.</p>

    <h2>Team Human Video</h2>

        </video>
    <p>
        a new dynamic portrait-based video artwork that creates a unique transformable face built from Team Human members. The piece will be created, displayed and collected through the blockchain network.</p>
        <p>
        The piece is an extension of a series of real-time portraits that I have been working on and exhibiting in recent years around the world.</p>
        <p>
In addition, a series of 5 original prints based on the piece will be created.
Purchased editions of Team Human art pieces are tracked and notarized with the identity of the buyer on the Ethereum blockchain.

    <h2>Team Human Art Performance</h2>
    <p>
    A new-media art that happens simultaneously in the physical world and the virtual world on the blockchain.</p><p>
    Created and performed to manifest the spirit of the new era of decentralized art.
    The work will be both created and presented in a ​performance art happening​ in which Shirley Short, the artist, and Dr. Mili Perry, a blockchain art expert interact with invited art collectors and blockchain fans in a workshop like settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participants take part in the Team Human project as it is dynamically takes form on the blockchain and in the session’s space. They will learn about the operative tools and potential of tomorrow’s art world.
        We will explore together how the blockchain will transform the art world and will provide an opportunity for participants to take part of in the creation of a blockchain art piece by Shirley Shor.
